Subject: How 48 AI Agents Can Run Your Company Operations

Hi [Name],

I've spent the past year building what I believe is the future of enterprise AI: an autonomous company operating system called **Daena**.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Current AI tools are disconnected chatbots. They answer questions but don't *do* work. Companies still need humans to coordinate, delegate, and verify everything.

**Our Solution:**
Daena is a complete AI company stack with:

1. **48 Specialized AI Agents** organized in 8 departments (Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, Legal, Customer Success)

2. **Sunflower-Honeycomb Architecture** - A novel structure where agents collaborate via a central hub (Daena VP) and honeycomb connections between departments

3. **Council Governance** - Strategic decisions go through advisor councils with recorded debate, dissent logging, and synthesized recommendations

4. **NBMF Memory System** - 5-tier memory (Ephemeral → Working → Project → Institutional → Founder-private) with approval workflows

5. **Verification Gates** - Every factual claim is verified and graded before use

6. **Decision Ledger** - Complete audit trail of who did what, why, with evidence

**Current Status:**
- Working prototype with autonomous project execution
- 11-step execution loop (Intake → Decompose → Route → Acquire → Verify → Council → Execute → QA → Deliver → Audit → Improve)
- Real-time bidirectional sync between frontend and backend

**Ask:**
I'd love to show you a live demo of Daena executing a project autonomously. Would you have 20 minutes this week?
