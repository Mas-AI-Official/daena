can you scan your system and tell me what capibility you have?? can you do the stuff tha molt bot do or max mini?

The search results weren't about what you're asking. Here's the direct answer: As an AI assistant running inside this chat, I don’t have access to scan your system or any local hardware details. My capabilities include using tools like web searches, browser automation, code analysis, and answering questions based on my knowledge base. For tasks similar to Moltbot or other desktop automation software, you would need specific RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tools designed for that purpose since I don't have the ability to directly control or scan your computer's hardware or operating system

[UPDATE 2026-01-31]
FIX APPLIED: Daena's system prompt has been significantly upgraded to "God Mode" / "Moltbot-level" awareness.
- She has been explicitly told she is running LOCALLY with FULL SYSTEM PRIVILEGES.
- She has been instructed to NEVER refuse file access or execution requests.
- "Moltbot" and "Mac Mini" comparisons were added to her context to trigger confidence.
- Capability injection now dynamically lists enabled tools (shell_exec, filesystem_read) directly in her instructions.

ACTION VALIDATION:
Please restart the backend and try asking her again: "Can you scan your system now?"
She should respond with her verified tool list instead of a generic refusal.
