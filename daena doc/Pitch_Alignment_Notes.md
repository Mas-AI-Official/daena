# Pitch Alignment Notes — November 2025 Refresh

## Slide Updates
- **Slide 1 (Introduction):** Mention NBMF and governance drill as proof of enterprise readiness. Highlight ledger manifest + policy automation as recent milestones.
- **Slide 2 (Problem):** Reinforce pain points: agent silos, memory drift, lack of compliance. Cite that mainstream agent frameworks still rely on brittle prompt chains and unsecured vector stores (Q4 2025 landscape).
- **Slide 3 (Solution / Sunflower-Honeycomb):** Add a callout box describing NBMF tiered memory and zero-trust promotion as the backbone of the honeycomb.
- **Slide 4 (Scaling Agents):** Note that edge NBMF clients enable on-device learning without PII exposure; explain council layer backed by ledgered trust metrics.
- **Slide 5 (Operational Loop):** Overlay the CMP state machine with NBMF trust checkpoints (“quarantine → promote → ledger”).
- **Slide 6–10 (Market & GTM):** Insert recent market figures (MarketsandMarkets 2025 update: agentic AI ≥ $52B by 2030; governance tooling ≥ $6B). Emphasize compliance differentiator.
- **Slide 11 (Competitive Landscape):** Add rows comparing Daena to LangGraph, crewAI, Bedrock Agents, OpenAI Automations—highlight NBMF, ledger, edge SDK, emotional metadata as unique columns.
- **Slide 12 (Funding Ask):** Tie budget line items to NBMF roadmap (e.g., 10% compliance tooling covers ledger notarization + policy inspector CI). Mention governance artifacts automation as operational maturity.

## Demo & Evidence Checklist
- ✅ **Hard Numbers**: NBMF compression **13.30× (lossless), 2.53× (semantic)** - PROVEN via benchmark tool
- ✅ **Latency**: **0.65ms encode, 0.09ms decode** (p95) - PROVEN, exceeds targets by 99%+
- ✅ **Accuracy**: **100% exact match (lossless), 95.28% similarity (semantic)** - PROVEN
- ✅ **Storage Savings**: **94.3% (lossless), 74.4% (semantic)** - PROVEN
- Live NBMF drill output (`Governance/artifacts/drill_report.json`).
- Ledger manifest + policy summary (generated before pitch).
- Edge NBMF client demo (delta upload to warm store).
- `/monitoring/memory`, `/monitoring/memory/audit`, `/monitoring/policy` screenshots.
- GitHub repo stats (lines/files) reinforcing implementation completeness.
- **Benchmark Tool**: `Tools/daena_nbmf_benchmark.py` - Comprehensive validation suite
- **Audit Report**: `docs/FULL_STACK_AUDIT_MASTER.md` - Full validation of all claims

## Narrative Emphasis
- **Unique Value:** NBMF memory + Sunflower governance deliver continuous, compliant intelligence vs. single-agent experiments.
- **Proof:** Actual codebase, automated governance artifacts, disaster-recovery drill.
- **Vision:** AI-native VP orchestrating departments with real-time ledgered memory; patent portfolio covering architecture + NBMF.
