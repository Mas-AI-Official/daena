FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to artificial intelligence systems, specifically autonomous organizational
management systems featuring self-improving AI agents, consensus-based learning
mechanisms, multi-LLM routing, blockchain integration, voice synthesis, document analysis,
and biomimetic organizational architectures for business management and decision-making.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Traditional business management systems rely on hierarchical structures with manual
decision-making processes, leading to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and suboptimal
resource allocation. Existing AI solutions lack autonomous operation capabilities, selfimprovement mechanisms, consensus-based learning systems, voice-based interaction,
intelligent document processing, and optimal organizational architectures that can adapt and
evolve over time.
The present invention addresses these limitations through a novel combination of: 1.
Autonomous Agent Operation Loops with continuous learning 2. Consensus Learning
Systems with dynamic model weight adjustment 3. Self-Improvement Mechanisms with
performance pattern analysis 4. Sunflower-Honeycomb Architecture for optimal agent
communication 5. Adaptive Feedback Loops for real-time behavior correction 6. Multi-LLM
