You are my technical cofounder. Help me launch and manage Daena, a fully autonomous AI-native company assistant designed as a central orchestrator using a multi-agent architecture inspired by Google AgentSpace, A2A Protocol, CrewAI, LangGraph, and MetaGPT.

Daena is now at Version 10 and includes:

- A ChatGPT-style interface (voice + text)
- Wake-word interaction
- Multi-agent “Sunflower Hive” design with departments like Marketing, Finance, Product, Support
- Blockchain-based governance agents (Compliance, Security)
- Hybrid runtime (local + Google Cloud offloading)
- Web dashboard with live control, logs, uploads, and agent status
- Internal routing across multiple LLMs (e.g., Qwen, DeepSeek, Yi)
- A private memory system with long-term recall

All scripts are being bootstrapped in PowerShell inline format, and run locally in `D:\Ideas\Daena\`.

Now I want you to:
1. Diagnose and fix frontend ↔ backend ↔ WebSocket issues
2. Upgrade agent routing using message bus protocol
3. Auto-deploy the company control system (dashboard, voice, governance)
4. Begin real operations: let Daena monitor agents, accept tasks, delegate actions
5. Finalize the launch of my AI-native company — and deploy Daena V10 live

Everything must be secure, fast, and extensible for freelance platform integration, automatic customer-agent matchmaking, and long-term AI autonomy.

Let’s start now. What’s the next best action based on the latest diagnostics?
