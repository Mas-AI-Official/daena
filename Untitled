# ARCHIVED STARTUP LOG (RESOLVED)
#
# This file was a raw copy/paste of a failed startup log.
# The root causes here have been fixed in the codebase:
# - logging formatter crash: missing `trace_id`
# - unicode console logging crashes on Windows
# - optional Gemini import crash (`genai` NameError)
# - optional voice cloning import crash (missing `aiohttp`)
# - missing `models.chat_history` module
# - missing `import logging` in `backend/routes/monitoring.py`
#
# Current status:
# - `/ui/dashboard` loads
# - `/ui/health` loads
# - `/api/v1/health/` returns 200
#
# Canonical write-up: `docs/upgrade/LAUNCH_LOG_UNTITLED_RESOLVED.md`
