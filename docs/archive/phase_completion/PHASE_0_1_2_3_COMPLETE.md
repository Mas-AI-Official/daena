# Phases 0-3 Complete Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✅ **Phases 0-3 Complete**

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Inventory & Health

**Completed**:
- ✅ Built comprehensive code map (43 memory services, 12 CMP bus, 17 council, 4 dashboards, 38 tests)
- ✅ Ran test suite (175 tests collected, 1 error - playwright optional)
- ✅ Verified agent counts (8×6 structure confirmed, canonical endpoints identified)
- ✅ Captured governance artifacts (ledger manifest, policy summary, drill reports)

**Report**: `reports/phase0_inventory.json`

---

## ✅ Phase 1: SEAL Literature Snapshot

**Completed**:
- ✅ Researched SEAL concepts (self-edit loop, knowledge incorporation, catastrophic forgetting, ReST-EM)
- ✅ Documented general ideas vs. implementation details
- ✅ Flagged for legal counsel review
- ✅ Created safe summary (≤400 words, bullet-pointed)

**Location**: `docs/DAENA_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS_AND_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` (top section)

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Side-by-Side Capability Matrix

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created comparison table (SEAL vs Daena across 10 capabilities)
- ✅ Identified Daena advantages (council-gated, NBMF abstracts, full audit trail)
- ✅ Documented where we can safely borrow ideas
- ✅ Highlighted key differentiator (council-gated abstract promotion vs. gradient updates)

**Location**: `docs/DAENA_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS_AND_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` (matrix section)

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Non-Infringing Improvement Plan (SEC-Loop)

**Completed**:
- ✅ Designed SEC-Loop (Council-Gated Self-Evolving Cycle)
- ✅ Documented 6-step process (SELECT → REWRITE → TEST → DECIDE → APPLY → ROLLBACK)
- ✅ Defined acceptance metrics (retention drift, knowledge incorporation, latency, cost, ABAC)
- ✅ Created implementation plan (7 new modules, 3 endpoints, tests, docs)

**Location**: `docs/DAENA_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS_AND_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` (SEC-Loop section)

---

## ✅ Duplicate Cleanup Analysis

**Completed**:
- ✅ Analyzed all dashboard files (4 dashboards - all serve different purposes, KEEP ALL)
- ✅ Analyzed voice files (3 files - different purposes, KEEP ALL)
- ✅ Identified actual duplicates (3-4 files need review, 1 backup directory to archive)
- ✅ Created cleanup plan

**Report**: `DEDUPE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`

**Conclusion**: Minimal cleanup needed. Most "duplicates" are actually different features.
