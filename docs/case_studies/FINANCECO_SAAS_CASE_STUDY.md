3. **No Cross-Tenant Learning**: Couldn't share insights without privacy concerns
4. **Slow Performance**: 300ms latency affecting user experience
5. **Compliance Risks**: GDPR/CCPA concerns with shared infrastructure

### Pain Points

- **Storage Costs**: $48,000/year for 5TB of multi-tenant data
- **Security Concerns**: Manual tenant isolation, risk of data leakage
- **Compliance Issues**: GDPR/CCPA requirements difficult to meet
- **Performance Issues**: 300ms latency, poor user experience
- **Missed Opportunities**: Couldn't leverage patterns across tenants

### Business Impact

- **Financial Impact**: $48,000/year storage costs, potential compliance fines
- **Operational Impact**: Manual tenant isolation, slow performance
