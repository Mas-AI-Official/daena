## Remaining Files in Root

The following files remain in the `docs/` root directory (intentionally):

- **`README.md`** - Main documentation index
- **`README_START_HERE.md`** - Getting started guide
- **`README_NAVIGATION.md`** - Navigation guide
- **`README_ENTERPRISE_DNA.md`** - Enterprise DNA documentation
- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - Project overview (main entry point)
- **`DATE_CORRECTION_INFO.md`** - Date correction information
- **`WHATS_NEXT.md`** - Next steps document

These files serve as entry points and navigation aids, so they remain in the root for easy access.

---

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Discoverability:** Files are now easy to find by category
2. **Better Organization:** Related documents are grouped together
3. **Easier Maintenance:** Clear structure makes it easy to add new documents
4. **Reduced Clutter:** Root directory is now clean and navigable
5. **Professional Structure:** Organized like a professional documentation system

## README Files Created

Created README files in each new folder to explain their purpose:
- `REPORTS/README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT/README.md`
- `TESTING/README.md`
- `TECHNICAL/README.md`

---

## Statistics

- **Files Organized:** ~140+ files
- **Folders Created:** 4 new folders
- **Folders Used:** 7 existing folders
- **Files Remaining in Root:** 7 files (intentional - navigation/entry points)
- **Organization Rate:** ~95% of files organized

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update main `README.md` to reflect new structure
2. ✅ Test that all file links still work
3. ⏳ Review and potentially consolidate duplicate files
4. ⏳ Create index files in each category if needed
