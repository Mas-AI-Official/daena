## The Challenge

### Problem Description

TechCorp Global was experiencing significant challenges with their AI infrastructure:

1. **Exploding Storage Costs**: Managing 10TB of AI-generated data at $96,000/year
2. **Slow Response Times**: Average latency of 500ms, causing poor user experience
3. **Limited Automation**: Single-agent systems couldn't handle complex cross-department decisions
4. **Accuracy Issues**: 92.5% accuracy causing errors and rework
5. **Vendor Lock-in**: Over-reliance on OpenAI with no alternatives

### Pain Points

- **Storage Costs**: Spending $96,000/year on storage for 10TB of data
- **Latency Issues**: 500ms average response time causing workflow delays
- **Accuracy Problems**: 7.5% error rate leading to costly mistakes
- **Scalability Concerns**: Unable to scale beyond current infrastructure costs
- **Limited Collaboration**: No way to coordinate decisions across departments

### Business Impact

- **Financial Impact**: $708,000/year in total AI infrastructure costs
- **Operational Impact**: Slow decision-making (500ms latency), limited automation
- **Strategic Impact**: Vendor lock-in, no competitive differentiation

### Previous Solutions Attempted

- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Too expensive ($600K/year API costs), single agent limitations
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Limited customization, siloed departments
- **Custom Multi-Agent Framework**: Development costs too high, maintenance burden
