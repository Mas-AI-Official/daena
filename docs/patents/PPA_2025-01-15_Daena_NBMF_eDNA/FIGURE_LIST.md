# Figure List

FIG.1 System Overview — High-level architecture diagram showing NBMF three-tier memory system (L1/L2/L3), eDNA governance layer (Genome/Epigenome/Lineage/Immune), and integration points.

FIG.2 Tiered Promotion/Eviction Pipeline — Flow diagram illustrating automatic memory promotion (L3→L2→L1) and eviction (L1→L2→L3) based on access frequency, age, and trust scores.

FIG.3 Merkle-Notarized Lineage — Cryptographic audit trail structure showing lineage chain construction, Merkle root computation, and verification proofs linking NBMF ledger transactions.

FIG.4 Genome/Epigenome Policy Flow — Diagram showing how Genome capability schemas combine with Epigenome tenant policies (ABAC, retention, SLO/SLA) to determine effective agent capabilities and memory access rules.

FIG.5 Immune Detection → Quarantine → Rollback — Threat detection workflow showing anomaly detection, policy breach identification, prompt injection detection, and automatic response actions (quarantine, quorum requirement, rollback).

FIG.6 Hardware Abstraction (CPU/GPU/TPU) — Architecture diagram showing DeviceManager abstraction layer routing tensor operations to optimal compute devices based on configuration and availability.

FIG.7 Cross-Tenant Learning via Abstract Artifacts — Flow diagram illustrating how abstracted NBMF artifacts (without raw data) enable safe cross-tenant knowledge sharing and pattern learning.
