## Micro Entity Status

### Qualification Requirements

To qualify as a Micro Entity, you must meet ALL of the following:

1. **Gross Income Limit**: Gross income in the previous calendar year did not exceed three times the median household income for that year (approximately $180,000 for 2024)

2. **Not a Named Inventor on More Than 4 Prior Applications**: Not named as an inventor on more than 4 previously filed U.S. patent applications (excluding provisional applications, international applications, and certain other exceptions)

3. **Not Assigned to Large Entity**: Not assigned, granted, or licensed (and not under obligation to assign, grant, or license) any rights in the invention to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is paid, had a gross income exceeding three times the median household income

4. **Not Employed by Large Entity**: Not employed by and not under obligation to assign invention to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is paid, had a gross income exceeding three times the median household income

### Micro Entity Certification

- Must file Form PTO/SB/15A (Certification of Micro Entity Status)
- Available at: https://www.uspto.gov/forms

## Filing Process

### Step 1: Prepare Documents

1. **Export to PDF**: Convert all Markdown files to PDF (see README.md)
2. **Prepare Figures**: Export SVG figures to PDF or image format (see README.md)
3. **Combine Documents**: Create a single PDF containing:
   - Cover Sheet (Form SB/16)
   - Abstract
   - Specification
   - Drawings (all figures)
   - Claims (optional)
   - Benchmarks (optional, for supporting documentation)

### Step 2: Complete Cover Sheet (Form SB/16)

Fill out Form SB/16 with:
- **Title**: "Neural-Backed Memory Fabric and Enterprise-DNA Governance System for Multi-Agent AI Systems"
- **Inventor**: Masoud Masoori
- **Correspondence Address**: [Your address]
- **Application Data Sheet**: If applicable
- **Micro Entity Status**: Check appropriate box

### Step 3: File with USPTO

**Option A: Electronic Filing (Recommended)**
- Use USPTO's Electronic Filing System (EFS-Web)
- URL: https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply/efs-web
- Requires USPTO account
- Faster processing and confirmation

**Option B: Mail Filing**
- Mail to: Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450
- Include check or money order for filing fee
- Slower processing

### Step 4: Receive Confirmation

- **Electronic Filing**: Receive confirmation number immediately
- **Mail Filing**: Receive confirmation by mail
- **Application Number**: USPTO will assign an application number (e.g., 63/XXXXXX)

## Important Reminders

### 12-Month Conversion Window

- **Critical**: You have 12 months from the provisional filing date to file a non-provisional application
- **Priority Date**: The provisional filing date becomes the priority date for the non-provisional application
- **Action Required**: Mark your calendar for the conversion deadline

### Non-Provisional Application

To convert to a non-provisional application, you must file:
1. Non-provisional application (Form SB/01 or equivalent)
2. Claims (required in non-provisional)
3. Filing fee (higher than provisional)
4. Reference to provisional application

### Applicant Information

- **Individual Inventor**: If filing as individual, inventor is the applicant
- **Company/Assignee**: If Mas-AI Technology Inc. is the assignee, list as applicant
- **Joint Ownership**: If multiple inventors/assignees, all must be listed

### Confidentiality

- Provisional applications are NOT published
- They remain confidential until a non-provisional is filed and published
- This provides 12 months of confidentiality
