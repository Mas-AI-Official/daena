# Abstract

A hierarchical memory storage and governance system for multi-agent artificial intelligence systems is disclosed. The system comprises a Neural-Backed Memory Fabric (NBMF)™ providing three-tiered memory architecture (L1 hot, L2 warm, L3 cold) with automatic promotion and eviction logic based on access patterns and age. The NBMF employs content-addressable storage (CAS) with SimHash-based near-duplicate detection, achieving significant compression ratios (13.30× lossless, 2.53× semantic) while maintaining high accuracy (100% lossless, 95.28% semantic similarity). An Enterprise-DNA (eDNA)™ governance layer overlays the NBMF, providing Genome-based capability schemas, Epigenome policy enforcement (ABAC, retention, SLO/SLA), Merkle-notarized lineage chains for cryptographic audit trails, and an Immune system for threat detection with automatic quarantine and rollback capabilities. The system includes hardware abstraction supporting CPU, GPU, and TPU compute pathways, and enables cross-tenant learning through abstracted artifacts without raw data leakage. The invention addresses limitations of existing vector-only memory systems and governance gaps in multi-agent AI deployments.
